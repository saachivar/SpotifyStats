## Purpose:
The purpose of our application is for people unknowing of music trends to become aware of them and find information 
about trending artists. With this application, one can know about the most popular artists straight from the Billboard 100 website
and find meaningful and informative information about them and their work.
## Tools Used:
We used GitHub, Git, Intellij, and JavaFX to create this application. We also used the Spotify API as well as Jsoup for webscraping.
Problems that our team ran in to:
Some problems we ran into included getting used to the git version control, parsing the JSON string to display on the GUI, and making
the calls to the Spotify API. 
## Public Frameworks Used:
This project uses the Spotify API to retrieve music data, including artist information, album details, and track listings. 
The Spotify API allows us to integrate Spotify's vast catalog of music into our application, providing users with access to their favorite songs and artists.
